    [`The instrumental “Requiem of Silence” perfectly shows the mood of “Masque of the Red Death,” conveying a sense of tragedy and drama, both mixed with an eerie undertone. As the story unfolds, readers know about the overwhelming dramatic tension, especially through the opulent yet decaying imagery of Prince Prospero’s masquerade. Poe writes, “But the echoes of the chime die away - they have endured but an instant - and a light, half-subdued laughter floats after them as they depart. And now again the music swells, and the dreams live, and writhe to and fro more merrily than ever, taking hue from the many-tinted windows through which stream the rays from the tripods.” (Poe 3). This shows that despite the Prince and his guests being reminded about the limited time they have from the clock, they choose to ignore it. We as the reader know that this cannot go one so it conveys a feeling of impending doom and maybe even some eeriness. By the end of the story, tragically, Prince Prospero and all of his guests die. `, `Requiem of Silence opens with a single, lingering note that builds a sense of tension and anticipation. Slowly, the sound of a violin begins to weave in, followed by the deep, resonant hum of a bass. But just as the listener starts to settle into this atmosphere, the music comes to a sudden halt. After this brief pause, the song picks up again, this time with the bass leading the way, but soon the violin takes over, guiding the melody.

As the composition unfolds, layers are gradually added—more instruments join in, including drums, giving the piece a richer, more complex texture. Then, another brief moment of silence creates suspense, before the music erupts in a powerful crescendo, building to an intense climax where all the elements come together to fully reveal the melody.

This description emphasizes the flow and build-up of the music, capturing the interplay between silence, tension, and the tragedy of the song. After a few repeats of the melody another intense crescendo starts and more instruments are added, making the listener feel the weight of every note.

        desc1: `A song that could connect with the metaphor used in “Masque of the Red Death” is “Another One Bites the Dust” by Queen. The song uses metaphors of death as something inevitable and relentless, much like in Poe’s story where death is unavoidable. In the song, the phrase “another one bites the dust” represents that people die all the time and it’s normal. The core metaphor in “Masque of the Red Death” is the Red Death itself, which represents the fact that death is inevitable, but there is another metaphor. The halls that Prince Prospero runs through all represent different stages of life, and the last black room is the stage where people die. The clock itself serves as a reminder of death.`,
        desc2: `Throughout the story “Masque of the Red Death,” there is a lot of vivid imagery explained in long paragraphs. The song “Dance Me to the End of Love” by Leonard Cohen uses clear, almost haunting imagery to describe the juxtaposition of beauty and death, which is close to how Edgar Allan Poe portrays the interplay between life and death. In the story, Prince Prospero and his guests create an artificial world of opulence and revelry within the abbey’s walls, while the Red Death looms outside. The imagery of the masquerade, with its vivid and eerie colors, reflects a false sense of security, much like the song’s references to “dancing through life” despite the knowledge of death. In lyrics, Cohen sings the name of the song, “Dance me to the end of love,” which compares with the way the guests in the story “dance” through their celebration, unaware of their impending doom. The story’s description of the rooms, especially the final black room with the red windows, mirrors the dark, almost foreboding tone of the song, where death is always present but unspoken. The “masked” figure in Poe’s story represents death itself and shows how futile the attempt to escape mortality is, much like the false hope of endless love or life that Cohen alludes to in his music. Both the song and the story vividly illustrate how people attempt to delay or deny death, but in the end, it is unavoidable.
