                    Theme: "Everybody Wants to Rule the World" by Tears for Fears
                  </h2>
                </nav>
                <p>The theme of “The Masque of the Red Death” revolves around the inevitability of death and the futility of trying to escape it. The song “Everybody Wants to Rule the World” explores themes of power and control, but it also hints at the pointlessness of such pursuits. In the story, Prince Prospero tries to evade death by isolating himself and his courtiers. Yet, despite his wealth and status, he fails to avoid death, and it claims both him and his guests. One lyric from the song is “Nothing ever lasts forever,” which goes along with the story's message. No matter how powerful one is or how safe they feel, they cannot escape death. One quote from the story is “And Darkness and Decay and the Red Death held illimitable dominion over all” (Poe 4). This quote is important because it directly states that the Red Death, which represents the black death or, in this case, just death itself, has power over all things.</p>

                        Characterization: “Viva La Vida” by Coldplay
                    </h2>
                  </nav>
                  <p>In the story, Prince Prospero is a static, flat character who remains resolute in his belief that he can outwit death itself. He showcases both direct characterization, as we are told about his wealth and status, and indirect characterization through his actions—such as hosting a lavish masquerade to distract from the plague. The song Viva la Vida is based upon King Louis XVI and a speech he might have given during his execution day. King Louis knew that the French people were unhappy for a while but chose to ignore it. This connects to Prospero’s extravagant ball, where he surrounds himself with opulence while ignoring the suffering outside his walls. Poe writes, "The ‘Red Death’ had long devastated the country. No pestilence had ever been so fatal, or so hideous." (Poe 1), showing the danger the Prince is trying to ignore. Another lyric from the song is "I used to rule the world / Seas would rise when I gave the word." These lyrics reflect the prince's former authority and his attempts to maintain control over his life and surroundings, which inevitably fails.</p>

                        Mood: "Requiem Of Silence” by Suehiro Kenichiro
                    </h2>
                  </nav>
                  <p id="moodText">The instrumental <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI3CzBKkQeE&t=2s ">“Requiem of Silence”</a> perfectly shows the mood of “Masque of the Red Death,” conveying a sense of tragedy and drama, both mixed with an eerie undertone. As the story unfolds, readers know about the overwhelming dramatic tension, especially through the opulent yet decaying imagery of Prince Prospero’s masquerade. Poe writes, “But the echoes of the chime die away - they have endured but an instant - and a light, half-subdued laughter floats after them as they depart. And now again the music swells, and the dreams live, and writhe to and fro more merrily than ever, taking hue from the many-tinted windows through which stream the rays from the tripods.” (Poe 3). This shows that despite the Prince and his guests being reminded about the limited time they have from the clock, they choose to ignore it. We as the reader know that this cannot go one so it conveys a feeling of impending doom and maybe even some eeriness. By the end of the story, tragically, Prince Prospero and all of his guests die. </p>

                        Tone: “Disturbia” by Rihanna
                    </h2>
                  </nav>
                  <p>The tone of the story would be very unsettling, foreboding, and dark. A song that fits this could be “Disturbia” by Rihanna. The song’s haunting lyrics capture the atmosphere of the story. Much like the characters in the story, the singer of the song is caught in a state of fear and confusion. The line “It’s a thief in the night to come and grab you/ It can creep up inside you and consume you” reflects the creeping inevitability of death that plagues characters in the story. The song shows a distorted perception of safety, much like the characters in “Masque of the Red Death.” Both the song and the story express the feeling of unsettledness and foreboding but choose to ignore it.

                        Climax: “The End” by The Doors
                      </h2>
                    </nav>
                    <p>The climax of “The Masque of the Red Death” is when Prince Prospero runs through the different rooms, all symbolizing different stages of life, then confronts the Red Death, where he dies. A fitting song to accompany this ending would be “The End” by The Doors. This song’s lyrics, particularly the line “This is the end, beautiful friend, this is the end, my only friend, the end,” reflect the fate that the Prince and his guests face. By the end of the story, death is the only certainty, and all escape attempts are rendered futile.</p>

                            Metaphor: “Another One Bites the Dust” by Queen
                        </h2>
                      </nav>
                      <p id="descLast">A song that could connect with the metaphor used in “Masque of the Red Death” is “Another One Bites the Dust” by Queen. The song uses metaphors of death as something inevitable and relentless, much like in Poe’s story where death is unavoidable. In the song, the phrase “another one bites the dust” represents that people die all the time and it’s normal. The core metaphor in “Masque of the Red Death” is the Red Death itself, which represents the fact that death is inevitable, but there is another metaphor. The halls that Prince Prospero runs through all represent different stages of life, and the last black room is the stage where people die. The clock itself serves as a reminder of death.
